stl2gpg : load Gate Pulse Generator from State Transition List


NB: STL format:
count,state   : at count, set state

BUT GPG format is
count,state   : set state until count

stl2gpg makes this transition by creating a first state entry to fill with zero's up until 
the first state.


test:
[pgm@hoy4 CUSTOM_GPG]$ ./stl2gpg.x86 | hexdump -ve '1/4 "%08x\n"'
